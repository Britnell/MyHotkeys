These are my everyday hotkeys for AutoHotkeys. Kept here so I can 
update and access them, but also to share the reference of my hotkeys.


## AutoHotkey

Anyone who likes using keyboard shortcuts when using windows 
will fall in love with  [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/ ).
In its basic form you can remap any key keyboard, and carry out any other functionality.
This goes evern further as you can then make one key perform a whole series or hotkeys.

This goes evern further with keyboard listeners and GUI screens and much more. 
The possibilities are endless.

All you need to do is [Download](https://autohotkey.com/download/) the Zip file and you can use the .exe to run you 
hotkey scripts without any installation. This means I can even use it on my work-computer.

You can also download the [Installer](https://autohotkey.com/download/) which associetas 
the .ahk file extension and allows you to run files automatically and at startup.

The [Web Documentation](https://autohotkey.com/docs/AutoHotkey.htm) is decent and the [Forum](https://autohotkey.com/boards/) is active.
